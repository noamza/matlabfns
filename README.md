# A set of useful functions for matlab

## installation

add this folder to your matlab path.
I beleive the preffered matlab way is to modify (or create) the `startup.m` script in matlab's path,  on windows this script is in `~\Documents\MATLAB\`, on mac or linux it should be somewhere on `$MATLABPATH`. In the startup script add the line `addpath 'yourpath\matlabfns'`;` 

good luck! n
